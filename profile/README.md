## 🛠️ What Do We Even Do?

### 🌐 [UnityTranslate](https://modrinth.com/mod/unitytranslate) (Public Mod)
UnityTranslate brings real-time speech-to-text translation to Minecraft, free of charge. Customize the translation display with speech bubbles above players' heads or as text boxes in your HUD. Supporting over 40 languages, UnityTranslate makes global in-game chat smoother than ever.

### 🔗 [Unity Hotspot](https://unitymultiplayer.online/) (Website)
UnityHotspot is your one-stop hub for everything Unity. It shows when any creator goes live, credits to the Unprod team, provides links to Unity's socials, and offers a quick glance at Unity's history. Like UnityTranslate, the code is open-source, so you can explore it and use it in your own projects.

### 👁️ [Origins SMP](https://modrinth.com/modpack/osmp) (Public Modpack)
Origins SMP is centered around the popular Origins mod, delivering a fun vanilla+ gameplay experience. It includes a selection of additional mods that enhance performance and bring more life to the world, keeping things fresh and exciting without shifting the focus away from Origins.

### 💻 Unitils (Private Mod)
Unitils is a custom suite of private features for Unity Multiplayer. This mod handles our customizable flag icons, custom tab configuration, live stream indicators, nickname system, and rank badges. Everything is custom-built to give us greater control over Unity's core features.
